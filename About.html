            <p>I am Aidan McMurray. I am told that I am interestinmg but often find describing myself to be a hassle. I enjoy video games and other forms of interactive media. I am also a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan, and I enjoy other Tabletop RPG's. I have a ten year old sister who is somewhat upset about the distance that we have now, even though I am still in the same city, she says that the lack of constant contact is the problem.
